# MVC-Appointment-Checker
NOTE: This program became outdated after the redesign of the NJ MVC website, so it doesn't work anymore.  
Checks for available Knowledge Test and Road Test appointments, and emails me when they become available so I can immediately take them.  
Personal information is removed from the files.  
Please download necessary modules (note that the program is obsolete, however).  
Three files ("LODI.py", "RANDOLPH.py", and "WAYNE.py") are for Road Tests and one file ("Knowledge Test Location Checker.py") is for Knowledge Tests.
